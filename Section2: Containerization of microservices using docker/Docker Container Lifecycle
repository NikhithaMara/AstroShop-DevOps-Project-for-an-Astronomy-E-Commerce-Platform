📦 Why Containerization of Microservices?
 
Instead of deploying monolithic applications on virtual machines like EC2 in AWS, when there is not much load, could lead to:
  🧠 Wasted resources (CPU, RAM)
  💸 Increased cost burden to the organization on cloud/on-premise platforms

We use containerization to package services independently and deploy them on a single machine. This allows:
⚙️ Efficient resource utilization
📉 Cost reduction
🧩 Service isolation and scalability

🐳 What is a Container?

A container is a lightweight, portable package that includes:
🧾 Application code
🧰 System and application dependencies
Containers run using the host machine's resources only when needed and they are light weight as they doesn't contain whole 
operating system.To create and manage containers, I use a containerization platform — Docker.

#### 🔁 Docker Lifecycle

To create containers using Docker, follow these 3 steps:
🛠️ Create a Dockerfile for the microservice
🧱 Build the Docker image using the command docker build 
🚀 Run the Docker image using the command docker run which creates containers
