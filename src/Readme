#### This is an open-source project by OpenTelemetry. The source code is forked from GitHub and consists of multiple microservices
written in different programming languages. As a DevOps engineer, I created Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests for each service, and configured both Ingress and a 
load balancer to expose the services in Kubernetes.
