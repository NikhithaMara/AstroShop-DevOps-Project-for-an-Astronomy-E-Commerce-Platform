I have craeted a eKS Cluster using terraform so now to intercat with the cluster i am using kubetcl coomad line tool i have installe dit on ec2 instance

kubectl get nodes - when i sau this command it wont give me any nodes because it doenst know the current cluster which kubectl is connected to
so to view the clusters we can use kubectl config view 
and context is a current clsuter which we are connected to so we use kubectl config current-context this gives current clsuetre to which kubectl is connected to and
the clsuetets info is present in kube-config file and move caross different clusters we can use kubectl config use-context clsutername so we nned to update nkube-config file for that we need aws cliu
so installed aws ci through aws documentation and configure aws cli using accesskey and secert access key by going into security credentials under your iam user on aws console else create it

now to update kube-config file use below command and now
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region (region-name) --name (cluster-name)
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-west-2 --name my-eks-cluster1

now when we do kubectl get nodes and kubectl config current-context displays ur current cluster connected to 
kubectl config current-context
arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:443370696298:cluster/my-eks-cluster1

Kubernetes Implementation overview:When we deploy application asw pods on k8s thye folwoing servbiecs we will be using k8s componets
service account: As how the users have an useraccount to commuinate through cluster liek if i wnat to communicate with the eks clsuetr i will use aws configure through cli and
provide baccess and seceret access token simiolary for a pod conatining amicroservuice needs a account to intercat with k8s cluster so taht srevice runs on a kubernets or
intercats with k8s which is called as serviec account by default ahs a permisison to run on to cluster within teh namespace and when we dont caretre a serviec account w ehvae default acountassigned
an difwe have k8s api srever interaction to us econfig file then w enend permisison for service account where w ecrete a role nad assign permisiisons and bind that toos ervice account
kubecytl get sa give sthe srevice account

Deployment:
