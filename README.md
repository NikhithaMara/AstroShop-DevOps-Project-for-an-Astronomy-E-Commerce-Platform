#### 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m Nikhitha Mara , an aspiring DevOps Engineer passionate about learning AWS and deploying projects to build real-world DevOps skills. I’m actively working on hands-on projects and sharpening my knowledge to break into DevOps roles. This repo documents my learning journey and showcases projects focused on cloud infrastructure, automation, CI/CD, and monitoring.

#### 🧠 Why I Chose This Project
In today's world, almost every company from brands like Nike to platforms like Amazon has an online store to sell products. This makes building an eCommerce application a common and highly relevant real-world scenario. This project gave me hands-on exposure to:
* Containerizing multiple microservices written in different progarmming languagues using Docker
* Managing communication between services via API calls
* Implementing a reverse proxy (Envoy) to route and validate requests before they reach backend services
* Using load generation tools to simulate real-world traffic
* Applying CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and infrastructure automation
This project reflects a full DevOps workflow applied to a real-world system, helping me strengthen my practical skills in deployment, scalability, and infrastructure management using AWS, IAM, EC2, S3, DynamoDB, Docker, Docker Compose, k8s, EKS.

#### 🛒 Project Overview
I chose the E-Commerce Demo Project open-sourced by OpenTelemetry, which simulates an online store selling astronomy products like telescopes. 
This project is built using a microservices architecture, with each service implemented in a different language or framework so devopsifying this
project gives me handson on different devops tools used in real world projects. Below is a list of the microservices and their descriptions:

#### 🧩 Microservices Overview
| Microservice        | Language     | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| frontend            | TypeScript   | Serves the website via HTTP. Automatically generates session IDs. |
| product-catalog     | Go           | Lists/searches products from a JSON file.                    |
| cart                | .NET         | Stores and retrieves shopping cart data using Valkey.        |
| shipping            | Rust         | Estimates shipping cost based on the cart and address.       |
| quote               | PHP          | Calculates shipping based on item count.                     |

#### 🌐 Application Flow:
Requests from the internet first hit a reverse proxy (server-side), which Validates traffic, Load balances requests and Routes them to the frontend service
The frontend serves the UI and communicates with backend microservices over HTTP/gRPC protocold
Microservices handle specific business logic like Cart, Shipping, Payment, Product Catalog, Email, etc.
A load generator simulates user traffic for testing and observability.
A React Native mobile app interacts with the backend via the same APIs.

#### 🚀 Dockerfile Creation Approach
This project contains multiple microservices organized within a single GitHub repository, with each microservice in its own folder.
* 📖 Reviewed the documentation in each microservice’s folder to understand how to build and run the service.
* 🖥️ Initially built and ran each microservice on an EC2 instance to verify functionality.
* 🛠️ Since the microservices are developed using different languages Java, Python, and Go. I created customized Dockerfiles for each service based on their specific requirements.
* This approach ensured all microservices are properly containerized and run smoothly in their respective environments.

#### 🚀 Deployed E-commerce Application on EKS Using Terraform
✅ Terraform Best Practices Followed:
* 🔒 Remote state is stored securely in Amazon S3, with DynamoDB used for state locking to avoid concurrent operations.
* 🚫 State files are not committed to GitHub, as they may contain sensitive information such as IPs, resource IDs, and secrets.
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Shared remote state enables team collaboration and prevents resource duplication or conflicts.
* 🔐 AWS authentication is handled through the configured AWS CLI, ensuring secure and authorized access to AWS services.
* 📁 A separate backend.tf file is used for backend configuration, improving readability and separation of concerns.

🚀 **Continuous Integration/Delivery(CI/CD)** — Automates build, test, and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions & ArgoCD.  

🔁 **CI** ensures the code is built and tested; **CD** delivers it to Kubernetes — faster, safer, and more efficient.  
✅ Implemented CI/CD for microservices architecture following below lifecycle for build and deployment

#### 🎨 Design Questions I Got When I Started

#### 🤔 Why choose microservice architecture over monolithic?
Scalability: Microservices allow independent scaling of components based on demand, unlike monoliths which scale as a whole.
Flexibility: Different services can use different technologies best suited for their tasks.
Faster Deployment: Smaller, focused teams can develop, test, and deploy services independently, speeding up release cycles.
Fault Isolation: Failures in one microservice don’t necessarily bring down the entire system.

#### ⚖️ Can’t I use a load balancer instead of a reverse proxy?
Load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers using simple algorithms (e.g., round-robin), ensuring even load distribution.
Reverse proxy can act as a load balancer but offers additional features like User authentication and validation(example block this ip address), URL interception and smart routing, SSL termination and Caching In short, a reverse proxy not only balances load but also adds flexibility and security layers, making it a more versatile choice.

#### 🧩 Why can't I just use Docker instead of Kubernetes?
Docker was introduced to solve the problem of "it works on my machine but not on yours." Containers package your application with all its dependencies, making it portable and consistent across environments. Containers are also lightweight, spin up quickly, and make better use of system resources compared to running multiple full VMs. This allows for more efficient resource utilization, especially in cloud or virtualized environments. However, Docker alone is not enough for production-grade deployments.
##### 🚨 Limitations of Docker without Kubernetes:
Containers are ephemeral (short-lived). If one crashes, it must be restarted manually or with basic Docker tools.
Networking is fragile. If one container communicates with another using its IP, and that container restarts, its IP may change — breaking communication.
Docker doesn't natively provide service discovery, load balancing, high availability, or self-healing.

#### ✅ Why Kubernetes?
Kubernetes was designed to orchestrate containers at scale. It handles:
* Service discovery and stable networking between containers
* Automatic restarts, scaling, and self-healing of failed containers
* Load balancing traffic
* High availability through clusters
* Disaster recovery features
For local development and testing, Docker is great. But for production, I used a managed Kubernetes service (Elastic Kubernetes Service(EKS)) to ensure
Stability, Scalability, High availability and Easier maintenance and disaster recovery

#### ✅ Challenges Faced & Resolved

#### Used Docker Compose for testing whole application with dependent microservices on EC2 instance and EC2 ran into a no space issue.
* Increased the size of the attached EBS volume from 8 GB to 30 GB using AWS.
* Checked disk storage with df -h and block devices with lsblk.
* Installed cloud-utils to enable resizing of partitions and file systems: sudo apt install cloud-utils
* Verified which partition is mounted on root (/).
* Increased the partition size and then resized the file system to utilize the expanded storage: sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1 — increase partition 1 on disk /dev/xvda sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1 — resize the filesystem on partition 1

#### 🔁 Difference Between Docker Compose & Kubernetes
* Docker Compose simply executes multiple containers together through a single command by putting all services in one file, instead of running each one separately and     manually handling dependencies.
* Kubernetes (K8s), on the other hand, is a container orchestration tool that provides high availability, service discovery, disaster recovery, auto-scaling,
  and self-healing.

#### How I Resolved a Merge Conflict in Git (GitHub)
* Encounter the Conflict:
  A merge conflict happens when two branches modify the same line of code.
* Open Conflicting Files:
  Git marks the conflicting files as unmerged and shows conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
* Resolve the Conflict:
  I resolved the conflict by opening the file and reviewing the changes in both branches, choosing the necessary changes to keep and discarding the ones that weren't needed,
  and removing the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) after making the necessary edits.
* Stage the Files:
  After resolving the conflicts, I staged the resolved files using git add.
* Commit and Push:
  I committed the resolved files with a clear message and then pushed the changes back to the remote repository.

#### 🚧 Challenges Faced in CICD
🔧 Challenges Faced: CI Failure on Pull Request Trigger
* The CI pipeline failed when triggered by a pull request due to missing permissions. The error showed that the GitHub Actions bot did not have read/write access to perform necessary tasks.
✅ Fix: Enabled the required read/write permissions in repository settings under:
Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions.
* Kubernetes Manifest Update Failed
The job to update the Kubernetes manifest with the newly built Docker image failed due to missing GitHub token permissions.
✅ Fix: Used GitHub Secrets to securely store a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with repo access, allowing the CI to commit and push updated manifests.
* CI Pipeline Failed Due to Deprecated Code
One of the microservices failed during the CI process because golint flagged usage of deprecated methods during static code analysis.
✅ Lesson Learned: This highlighted the importance of maintaining code quality and keeping dependencies up to date — a true real-world debugging scenario.

#### ✅ Best Practices Followed in CICD
* Used GitHub Secrets Securely
* Stored sensitive data such as Docker Hub credentials (username/token).
* Stored GitHub token used for pushing updated Kubernetes manifests back to the repo.
* Avoided hardcoding secrets or credentials in the codebase.
* Granted only the minimum required permissions for workflows (principle of least privilege).
  
#### ⚠️ Challenges Faced & Solved in k8s

#### 🕸️ Kubernetes Networking
* I set up Kubernetes inside a **VPC** with private subnets.
* Initially, I realized that **ClusterIP** services are only accessible **within the cluster**.
* To connect pods from EC2 instances in different subnets within the same VPC, I used **NodePort**, exposing pods on static node ports.
* For external access, I configured **LoadBalancer** services, which created cloud load balancers (AWS ELB).
* I learned that pods communicate through **Services**, not direct IPs, because pod IPs can change after restarts.

#### 🚦 Ingress and Load Balancer Controllers
* I found **LoadBalancer** services simple but costly when scaling many microservices.
* To optimize, I implemented **Ingress** with path- and host-based routing rules using a single load balancer.
* I deployed the **Ingress controller** (AWS ALB Ingress Controller) as a pod to manage load balancer creation automatically.
* Setup involved attaching IAM roles and policies to service accounts via **IAM OIDC providers**.
* BY IAM OIDC Ingress Controller has access outsid ethe EKS Cluster to create ALB
* I installed the Ingress controller using **Helm**.
* For DNS, I used **Route53** with a domain registered on GoDaddy.
* DNS propagation took up to **48 hours**, which was very long time.
  
* By default, Kubernetes services are only accessible **inside the cluster**; to access pods externally or from other subnets, I had to use **LoadBalancer** services.
* I discovered that LoadBalancer services don’t support advanced routing or HTTPS setup through manifests, requiring manual configuration.
* To reduce costs and gain routing flexibility, I switched to using **Ingress controllers**, even though they require additional setup.

#### 🐞 Debugging Tips I Used
* I used `kubectl exec` to monitor CPU and memory usage inside pods.
* I checked pod logs frequently with `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to troubleshoot issues.
